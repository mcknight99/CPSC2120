In this project, you will write a recursive program to calculate the nth Fibonacci number.  Fibonacci numbers are defined according to the formula below:

F(0) = 0, F(1) = 1;

F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2) for n > 1

 

Name your function Fibonacci.  It will take an integer parameter for the value of n, and return an integer that is the nth Fibonacci number.  

A main should not be necessary, but if it is required name it testerMain.cpp.
