This project will test your ability to read in an unknown number of items from stdin.

You will make a method named ReadStdIn2, which takes no parameters.  It will read from standard in until the input is "q", then stop.

This method will print an integer, the number of items you have read in (not including "q").  Input is case-sensitive.

Your main should be named "testerMain.cpp".
