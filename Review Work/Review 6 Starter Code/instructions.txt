This will test your ability to use loops to modify arrays.  Your function will be passed a double array by reference (with the length as a second parameter.  See starter code).  When your array finishes execution, all values in the array must be incremented by one.

Your function should be named LoopThrough.  A main should not be necessary, but if it is, name it testerMain.cpp.
