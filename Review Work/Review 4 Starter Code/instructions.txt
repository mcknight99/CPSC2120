In this assignment, you will read input from stdin until you see "q", just as in the last assignment.  

However, once you see "q", you will write everything that was inputted back out to stdout on a single line, with an end-line at the end.

Your function should be called "ReadWrite", and your main file should again be called "testerMain.cpp".
