A repository designed to synchronize work between my laptop and desktop so I can work on classwork from either machine at any time. 
Current plans are to remain private for the time being but may become public in the future ~if~ the classwork is publicly sharable.

Make is very handy for make files. I followed this installation and only went to step two and using make commands works great in the built in VSCode terminal. wsl --install
